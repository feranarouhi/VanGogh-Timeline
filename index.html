            <h3>Chronology of van Gogh's life</h3>
        </section>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>30 March 1853</strong>
                -Vincent Willem van Gogh was born in Groot-Zundert, a village in the southern Netherlands.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1869</strong>
                -Van Gogh worked for Goupil & Cie, an art dealership in The Hague.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1873</strong>
                -Vincent is transferred to Goupil's London branch. He lodges with a landlady
                 and her daughter in south London. He falls in love with the daughter,
                 but his feelings are not reciprocated. This is the first of a number of 
                 disastrous relationships Vincent had with the opposite sex.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1880</strong>
                -Vincent goes to Brussels to study art. Theo provides him with financial support
            </li>
            <li>

                <strong>1881</strong>
                -Vincent falls in love with his cousin, Kee Vos-Stricker (who he called KV).
                But she rejects his advances (saying "no, never, never" when he proposed out of the blue).
                Vincent follows KV to Amsterdam and barges into her parents' house, where she is staying.
                When they won't let him see her, Vincent burns himself by holding his hand over a candle.
                Later, in a letter to Theo of December 1881, Vincent writes:
                <br> "... I'd like to be with a woman, I can't live without love, without a woman. 
                I couldn't care a fig for life if there wasn't something infinite, something deep, something real."
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>March 1886</strong>
                -Vincent moves to Paris to live with Theo, who is by now a successful art dealer.
                 Theo introduces Vincent to the impressionists who were living in Paris at the time, 
                 including Camille Pissarro and Edgar Degas. But Vincent is a difficult house guest and 
                 the two brothers eventually quarrel: the somewhat boorish Vincent cramps his sophisticated brother's style!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>February 1888</strong>
                -Vincent moves to Arles, in the south of France. His plan is to establish an artist's colony where like-minded painters can work, discuss their ideas and enjoy life. Sadly, though somewhat inevitably, this utopia fails to materialise.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>May 1888</strong>
                -Vincent moves into the famous Yellow House, where he rents four rooms. Theo eventually persuades Paul Gauguin to move in with Vincent. Vincent is excited by this news and goes about decorating the Yellow House: he fills the guest room, adjoining van Gogh's bedroom, with freshly painted canvasses (including a version of The Sunflowers).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Jan-April 1889</strong>
                -Theo travels to see Vincent. He arranges treatment in a local hospital in the first instance, but by May 1889 it becomes clear that Vincent will need more specialist treatment in a local asylum
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>June 1889</strong>
                -Van Gogh paints Starry Night, one of his most famous works, from his room in St Remy
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>May 1890</strong>
                -Van Gogh leaves the St Remy asylum and travels to Auvers-sur-Oise, a small village close to Paris. He is to be supervised by Dr Paul Gachet. At first he is hopeful that Gachet will be able to help him, and the two men certainly get on (Vincent paints Gachet's portrait on two occasions).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>27 July 1890</strong>
                -Van Gogh goes to paint wheatfields, but shoots himself in the chest*.
                 He staggers back to his lodgings but dies two days later.
                * It is most likely that van Gogh's death was suicide. However, van Gogh scholars Steven Naifeh and 
                Gregory White Smith have proposed a different theory: that he was murdered by two local boys, but that he pretended that he had shot himself so as to keep them out of trouble.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>30 July 1890</strong>
                -Van Gogh is buried in Auvers-sur-Oise.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1973</strong>
                -The Van Gogh Museum opens in Amsterdam.
            </li>

                He is now famed for the great vitality of his works which are characterised by expressive and emotive use of brilliant colour and energetic application of impastoed paint.
